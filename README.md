# ffmpeg_crop_and_trim
I could not easily find a repository that shows how to crop and trim videos using ffmpeg, so I created this repository.
This code crops and trims a video file using a list of start and end times.

The code is in jupyter network and the code details are provided in the comments.

requirements:
ffmpeg 1.4

to install requirements run the code below in the active environment:
pip install ffmpeg

works with different video formats (mp4, mkv, avi, etc)

refrence: https://pypi.org/project/ffmpeg/
